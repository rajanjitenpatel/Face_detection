# Face_detection
All pre-defined libraries and functions in OpenCV are c-codes which get executed serially. These frameworks are available for CUDA as well, but the limitation with using CUDA is the NVIDIA graphics card which obviously is not available with everyone! With the advent of a stable version of OPENMP in late 2015, it made parallel processing easier and increased its reach amongst developers. OPENMP gained popularity owing to its portability and mainly because it could perform parallel processing on normal computers having multiple cores. 
In my research at kalp systems, I have implemented the face detection algorithm and parallelized it using OPENMP.
